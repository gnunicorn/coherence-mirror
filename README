As time evolves you will find in this file more detailed
installation and basic configuration instructions.

For now please pardon the inconvenience
and have a look @ http://coherence-project.org


Installation from source
========================

After downloading and extracting the archive or having done a svn checkout,
move into the freshly created 'Coherence' folder and install the files
with

  sudo python ./setup.py install

This will copy the Python module files into your local Python package folder
and the coherence executable to '/usr/bin/coherence'.

Quickstart
==========

To just export some files on your hard-disk fire up Coherence with
an UPnP MediaServer with a file-system backend enabled.

  coherence --plugin=backend:FSStore,content:/path/to/your/media/files

A list of all available backends will get printed with

  coherence --help

More information about the backends and their specific configuration:

  http://coherence-project.org/wiki/Backends

For a continuous operation the use of a config file is highly recommended.

  http://coherence-project.org/wiki/XMLConfig

The config file can be placed anywhere, coherence looks by default for $HOME/.coherence,
but you can pass the path via the commandline option '-c' to it too.

  coherence -o /path/to/config/file -more -options


Troubleshooting
===============

If your MediaServer doesn't show up on your client most of the time
networking issue are responsible for that.

 - Your system has more than one network interface?
 
   Specify the network interface to use in the config file.

 - Add a multicast route, pointing to the proper network interface

   route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 eth0

 - Any firewall on your system?
